        of non-free tokens on the board.
        
        For the Early Game, if the sum of pieces is lower than a constant, then we are 
        looking into a bloomtable containing a list of well-known Opening Move.
        If one is find, we are playing this move.
        
        For the Mid-Game, we are doing a simple AlphaBeta Pruning over few depth.
        Two experimental modes has been implemented, One using the parallelization
        (which will create process only for the fist layer of AB) and another one
        is using Bloom Filter. Both of them are currently not used, because we are
        losing a bit of performance regarding the result we will obtain. The parallelization
        will also reduce the pruning because we will not pass the alpha and beta value 
        over process.
        Concerning the BloomCheckerFirst, the goal was to instanciate every board that we saw
        with a pretty high heuristic value while we are looking over the AB tree.
        Unfortunatly, with the current implementation, we will instanciate these board, even
        if it could lead to some wrong path.
        
        The End-Game is used when the number of pieces is greater than another constant. This phase
        of the game currently have a lot less available move than the "mid-game", so we increased
        the depth for the AB-pruning.
        
        
        In case of problem (ie. no moves has been found, then None), We Generate a move using a simple
        heuristic that will return the best move over the number of tokens flipped. This function/way of work
        shall be replaced in the future.
